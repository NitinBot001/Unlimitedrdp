Maize (*Zea* *mays* L*.*), the queen of cereals, surpasses all other
food crops in its ability to adapt to the diverse agro-ecological niches
and being cultivated from 58oN to 55oS latitude. It is the leading
cereal crop in the world with more than one billion tonne production. In
India, it holds third rank among the cereals, after rice and wheat in
terms of area and production. Traditionally, maize is grown as a
*kharif* crop in India, but from 1970s its expansion started in *rabi*
season and later on in the *spring* season too. Now, the crop is grown
round the year and in all agro-ecologies throughout India, not only for
grain but also for specialized purposes like sweet corn, baby corn and
for silage making.

Maize is widely used as food, feed, fodder, industrial raw material and
in recent past for bio-fuel production. It is a key crop in doubling
farmers' income as maize can be integrated eﬀectively with dairy,
poultry, ﬁsheries and piggery. Speciality corns has a special role in
value chain development. Considering the changing food habits in India,
the demand of maize is supposed to increase in the near future. To meet
the growing demand, there is a need to enhance maize productivity
through adoption of the best production practices by the maize farmers.

I am happy to know that ICAR-Indian Institute of Maize Research,
Ludhiana is bringing out a publication on ''*Maize* *production* *for*
*food,* *feed* *and* *fodder*'' which have complete cultivation
information for normal and specialty maize right from the sowing to
harvesting. I congratulate the authors for their contributions in
bringing out this comprehensive and important publication. I am sure
that this publication will be useful for researcher, farmers and other
stakeholders for enhancing the maize production and productivity in the
country.

> **PREFACE**

Declining water resources, degrading soil health, higher production
cost, lesser proﬁtability and climate change are the major challenge
before Indian agriculture. Resource use smart crops which can give more
proﬁt from lesser resources are need of the hour. Maize is one such crop
with highest production potential and comparatively lesser water
foot-prints. It is a multi-purpose crop being used as food, feed,
fodder, and raw material for various industrial products including
bio-fuels.

Maize is the leading cereal crop in the world with more than one billion
tonne production and in India it holds third rank after rice and wheat
in terms of area and production. Traditionally maize in India used to be
consumed as food crop. However, over time maize has become rather an
industrial crop than food crop as over 75% of the maize produced in
India is used for industrial purchases, mostly as feed and source of
starches. Being industrial in nature maize can ensure higher
remuneration. Further, specialty corns, baby corn and sweet corn with
short to medium duration cropping period can play important role in
diversiﬁcation in peri-urban agricultural systems and nutritional
garden. They ﬁt well in integrated farming system, where the byproduct
of specialty corn, i.e. green fodder can support livestock very well.
During last 50 years, maize productivity has increased from around 0.99
t/ha to 3.1 t/ha but still we are far behind leading maize producing
nations. Lesser adoption of improved production practices is one among
the key factors contributing low productivity of Indian maize, besides
prevalence of rainfed growing condition, limiting eﬀects of various
biotic and abiotic stresses among others. Improved high yielding
cultivars coupled with better crop management is bound to increase
productivity of maize in India.

The compiled production practices of various types of maize is expected
help to researcher, extension workers and farmers in enhancing maize
production and productivity in the country.

>
> **Introduction**
>
> Climate change has far serious implications concerning the food and
> nutritional security of nations like India where agriculture is the
> backbone of nation's economy and growing population is the biggest
> reason to worry. Rural India largely depends on its natural resources
> and farming for earning its livelihood and food security and climate
> change aﬀects the natural ecosystem progressively. In future, it will
> be even more diﬃcult to predict occurrences of phenomena such as
> droughts, ﬂoods, cloud bursts, etc. due to climate change.
> Consequently, farmers must adapt to the changing climate to ensure
> optimum crop yields and farm income. Farmers in general and small and
> marginal farmers in particular must enhance the resilience of
> agriculture to face the upcoming challenges. Transforming agriculture
> through adoption of climate resilient practices and technologies would
> be inevitable to stabilize agricultural production and enhance
> farmer's income.
>
> Participatory demonstration of location speciﬁc and climate smart
> technologies is necessary for enabling farmers to cope climatic
> variability and extreme weather phenomenon. Adoption and spread of
> these climate resilient technologies would help farmers fetch adaption
> gains and reduce the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions alongside.
> Considering the urgent need to address the issue of climate change at
> the farm level, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
> launched National Initiatives in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA)
> in February, 2011, which was renamed as National Innovations in
> Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) to emphasize the role of
> evolving innovations. Resilience is the capability of the production
> system to resist negative impacts of climate change and also the
> capacity to recover quickly after the damage. Therefore, National
> Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) was formulated to
> develop and demonstrate region speciﬁc improved technologies that
> would enhance the resilience of Indian agriculture to climate change
> thereby addressing climate vulnerability and its negative impacts. The
> emphasis on adaptation to climate variability necessitates appropriate
> responses to contingency situations. Considering the need to enhance
> the resilience of Indian agriculture production system to climate
> variability and climate change, the center theme should be the
> Sustainability of the production systems facing natural resource
> degradation. Thus, the centre of attraction in NICRAis not the
> enhancement of productivity but the ability of the existing system to
> cope with the vulnerability and to improve the natural resource use
> eﬃciency for sustaining the productivity gains that have been achieved
> already. The project aimed to enhance resilience of Indian agriculture
> to climate change and climate variability through its diﬀerent
> components namely Strategic Research, Technology Demonstration,
> Capacity Building and Sponsored/Competitive Grants.

> **Uses** **of** **Maize** **Feed**
>
> Approximately 60% of total maize production in India is used for
> preparation of concentrated feeds for cattle, poultry and piggery as
> source of energy. Fishery feed also uses maize as an important
> component. The yellow colour of maize is very useful in providing
> yellow colour to egg yolk and yellow tinge to the milk.
>
> **Food**
>
> Grain maize, pop corn, baby corn, sweet corn and green maize cobs are
> widely used as human food. Most commonly used forms are as Chapattis,
> porridges, corn ﬂakes, boiled or roasted green ears, pop corn, baby
> corn products like salad, vegetable, pickle, pakoda, kheer, laddu and
> halwa; sweet corn products like soup, chat, corn cheese balls, masala
> corn and salad etc. Around 13% of total maize grain production in
> India is used as food and 7% as processed food, however this does not
> include use of specialty maize, particularly baby corn, sweet corn and
> green cobs.
>
> **Industrial** **uses**
>
> Maize acts as a raw material in the manufacture of starch, syrup,
> dextrose, oil, gelatine etc. Corn ﬂour is used as a thickening agent
> in the preparation of many edibles like soups, sauces and custard
> powder. Corn syrup is used as sweetener in processed foods such as
> soft drinks and candies. Corn sugar (dextrose) is used in
> pharmaceutical formulations. Maize oil is widely used as a cooking
> medium and it has the quality of reducing cholesterol in the human
> blood. Maize oil has use in cosmetics and pain industry as well. Corn
> gel because of its moisture retention character is used as a bonding
> agent for ice-cream cones. Maize stalks are made into paper and wall
> board; husks are used as ﬁlling material; cobs are used directly for
> fuel, to make furfurol, fermentable sugars, solvents, liquid fuels,
> charcoal, pulp, paper and hard boards. Approximate 14% of total maize
> production in India is utilised for industrial purposes.
>
> **Bio** **fuel** **and** **bioplastic**
>
> Maize is also used for liquid bio-fuel (ethanol) production in USA.
> The ethanol is used as transportation fuel after blending with
> gasoline. India is also slowly opening up use of maize grain for
> ethanol production. The maize starch is also used for making
> biodegradable plastic using poly lactic acid (PLA) which will be very
> useful in the scenario of banning single use of plastic.
>
> **Forage** **and** **silage**
>
> Maize stalk is used to feed dairy animals in the form of green fodder,
> dry roughages andsilage. Maize fodder has higher digestibility than
> any other non-leguminous forage crops and it does not contain any
> toxic substances. Maize is also preferred for silage making over other
> fodders, as maize plant is easy to chaﬀ, requires less labour and its
> silage is soft.

> type of grain and do not need pre-cleaning of grains. Its drying rate
> ranges between 2-10 t/h depending on crop type, grain moisture content
> etc. The optimum moisture in grain for long-term storage should be
